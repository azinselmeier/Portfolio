## Setup
## Project Status
Project is: in progress. As the project is a personal portfolio, this project will stay in progress as I continue to update it as developments occur in my life.
## Room for Improvement
Areas to be further developed with this project includes **the addition of more pages**, as the current site is one landing page with multiple sections. In the future, users may explore adding more pages to the site to increase the amount of information the site can display.
